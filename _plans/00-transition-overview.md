# Claude Docker TypeScript Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to migrate the Claude Docker development environment from bash scripts to a modern TypeScript-based CLI application. The migration will improve maintainability, type safety, testing capabilities, and developer experience while maintaining backward compatibility during the transition period.

## Migration Goals

1. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for compile-time error checking
2. **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration and modular architecture
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. **Developer Experience**: Better IDE support, autocomplete, and documentation
5. **User Experience**: Improved error messages, progress indicators, and interactive prompts
6. **Code Quality**: Enforced through ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Set up TypeScript project structure
- Configure build system and tooling
- Create core services and utilities
- Implement configuration management

### Phase 2: Core Migration (Week 2-3)
- Migrate `devvy` CLI main entry point
- Port critical commands (start, stop, connect)
- Implement Docker and Compose services
- Create comprehensive test suite

### Phase 3: Complete Migration (Week 3-4)
- Port remaining commands (cleanup, setup, rebuild)
- Migrate VS Code/Cursor configuration sync
- Update documentation
- Create migration guide for users

### Phase 4: Polish & Release (Week 4-5)
- Performance optimization
- Error handling improvements
- User acceptance testing
- Release preparation

## Success Criteria

1. All existing functionality preserved
2. 80%+ test coverage
3. Performance equal or better than bash scripts
4. Zero breaking changes for end users
5. Comprehensive documentation
6. Automated CI/CD pipeline

## Risk Mitigation

- **Parallel Development**: Keep bash scripts functional during migration
- **Feature Flags**: Allow users to opt-in to TypeScript version
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to revert to bash scripts
- **Incremental Migration**: Port one command at a time
- **User Testing**: Beta testing with select users before full release
